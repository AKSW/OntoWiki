"""Over the past 3 years, the semantic web activity has gained momentum with the widespread publishing of structured data as RDF. The Linked Data paradigm has therefore evolved from a practical research idea into a very promising candidate for addressing one of the biggest challenges in the area of intelligent information management: the exploitation of the Web as a platform for data and information integration in addition to document search. To translate this initial success into a world-scale disruptive reality, encompassing the Web 2.0 world and enterprise data alike, the following research challenges need to be addressed: improve coherence and quality of data published on the Web, close the performance gap between relational and RDF data management, establish trust on the Linked Data Web and generally lower the entrance barrier for data publishers and users. With partners among those who initiated and strongly supported the Linked Open Data initiative, the LOD2 project aims at tackling these challenges by developing:
<ol>
<li>enterprise-ready tools and methodologies for exposing and managing very large amounts of structured information on the Data Web,</li>
<li>a testbed and bootstrap network of high-quality multi-domain, multi-lingual ontologies from sources such as Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap.</li>
<li>algorithms based on machine learning for automatically interlinking and fusing data from the Web.</li>
<li>standards and methods for reliably tracking provenance, ensuring privacy and data security as well as for assessing the quality of information.</li>
<li>adaptive tools for searching, browsing, and authoring of Linked Data.</li>
</ol>
We will integrate and syndicate linked data with large-scale, existing applications and showcase the benefits in the three application scenarios of media & publishing, corporate data intranets and eGovernment. The resulting tools, methods and data sets have the potential to change the Web as we know it today.

<p>The Stichting Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica (CWI) is the Dutch national research institute for mathematics and computer science.

In addition to the standard ways of disseminating scientific knowledge, CWI actively pursues joint projects with external partners, provides consulting services, and stimulates the creation of spin-off companies. Special efforts are made to make research results known to non-specialist circles, ranging from researchers in other disciplines to the public at large. CWI also manages the Benelux Office of the W3C and hosts both the Semantic Web Activity Lead and the chair of the XHTML and XForms Working Group.</p>
<p>CWI has always been very successful in participating in European research programmes (e.g. VITALAS, K-SPACE, QAP, CREDO, MUSCLE, and others) and large-scale national research programmes (e.g., programmes BRICKS, MultimediaN, and VL-e; NWO Veni, Vidi, Vici grants). It has extensive experience in managing these collaborative research efforts. CWI is also strongly embedded in Dutch university research: about twenty-five of its permanent senior researchers hold part-time positions as professors at universities and many projects are carried out in cooperation with university research groups. CWI receives a basic funding from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), amounting to about two third of the institute’s total income. The remaining third is obtained through national research programmes, international programmes, and contract research commissioned by industry. CWI hosts a staff of 235 full time employees, 50 permanent scientific staff, 135 temporary scientific staff, and 50 support staff.

Finally it hosts a number of open data and content projects, from a web application to represent UK public finance using best of breed visualization technologies to project to a database of artistic works that have fallen into the public domain. Crucially the Foundation acts as a hub, drawing together representatives from across the knowledge society - from academics, public servants and entrepreneurs to data experts, archivists and web developers. Forums, workshops and an annual conferenceserve to strengthen this network.</p>
