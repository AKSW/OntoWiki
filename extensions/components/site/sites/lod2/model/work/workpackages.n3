The starting point is OpenLink Virtuoso and MonetDB on the database side and Sindice on the information retrieval side. The present data volumes handled are around 10 billion RDF triples and the target is over the 1 trillion triples. The approach is scale-out out (physical) complemented with significant scalability improvements in the RDF engine (logical): Physically, when data grows, servers can be added and data redistributed without interruption of service, ibid for server failure. Logically, there is no point answering questions nobody is asking. Therefore the base data is kept as RDF with text indexing and search ranking. Additional inference results or indices for caching joins are made as a by-product of querying; further exploitation of such (partially) materialized inferences through the graph at run-time is to exploit structural correlations in the graphs.""";
