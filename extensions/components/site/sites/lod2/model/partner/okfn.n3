<p>The Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF) is a not-for-profit organization founded in 2004 and dedicated to promoting open knowledge in all its forms. It is a European leader in this field and prominent on the international stage. The Foundation has pioneered work in developing robust legal mechanisms for sharing data - and has taken a central role in helping to develop standards for openness in knowledge and services. It also works on the infrastructure for open data users and producers. This includes CKAN, a community driven resource for open data, which is currently being used by the UK Government for its Data.gov.uk project, and KForge, a suite of tools for knowledge development being used by academic researchers and civic software developers. Finally it hosts a number of open data and content projects, from a web application to represent UK public finance using best of breed visualization technologies to project to a database of artistic works that have fallen into the public domain. Crucially the Foundation acts as a hub, drawing together representatives from across the knowledge society - from academics, public servants and entrepreneurs to data experts, archivists and web developers. Forums, workshops and an annual conferenceserve to strengthen this network.</p>
