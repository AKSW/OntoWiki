    lod2:content """<p>Universität Leipzig is one of the oldest (founded 1409) and largest (30.000 students) universities in Germany and focuses on interdisciplinary research in the life sciences, cognitive sciences and linguistics as well as mathematics and computer science. The Institute for Applied Computer Science (InfAI) at Universität Leipzig hosts world class research groups in service sciences, knowledge engineering and management as well as natural language processing. The approximately 20 researchers of the Agile Knowledge Engineering and Semantic Web (AKSW) research group at InfAI are establishing theoretical results and scalable implementations for the field. Particular emphasis is given to areas such as ontology creation and manipulation, knowledge extraction, ontology learning and information & data integration on the Semantic Web. The implemented tools and services developed by the group enjoy considerable popularity, the open-source semantic web framework OntoWiki for example is downloaded more than 500 times each month and applied in usage scenarios ranging from the authoring of bio-medical ontologies to knowledge management for the enterprise. InfAI is leading several large-scale collaborative research projects on the national and EU levels such as OntoWiki (EU FP7), Internet Media Businesses (EU SMART), PreBIS (German BmbF) and Factory ServNet (Eureka) and participates in many more.</p>""";
    lod2:abstract """Project coordination; develop knowledge structuring and enrichment algorithms as well as browsing, visualization and authoring interfaces; collaborate with OKFN in order to employ LOD2 results in the GovData.eu use case.""".

OntoWiki is a tool providing support for agile, distributed knowledge engineering scenarios. It facilitates the visual presentation of a knowledge base as an information map, with different views on instance data. It enables intuitive authoring of semantic content, with an inline editing mode for editing RDF content, similar to WYSIWIG for text documents.""";
