    lod2:abstract """SWC adopt the tool Poolparty, a self-developed modeling tool for corporate thesauri, as a component for the LOD2 stack. SWC will provide its expertise in technology assessment and business development when it comes to evaluate the economic rationale, organisational effects and the commercial potential of semantic web technologies. SWC will investigate governance and regulatory issues such as competition, IPR issues and privacy thereby contributing to the use cases in WP 7, 8 & 9. Our expertise in communicating the principles, technologies and especially business needs for semantic web applications on the one hand and the „translation“ of practical problems into technological concepts on the other hand will help to disseminate the findings beyond the scope of the use cases.""".
