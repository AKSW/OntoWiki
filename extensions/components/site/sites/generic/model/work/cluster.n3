Secondly, case studies are also used to validate the results and evaluate their applicability and impact. User centric activities will, additionally, validate our technologies viz. provide the evaluation environment. Each case study will incorporate a technology partner who is responsible for supporting the use case partners in deploying and using LOD2 R&D results and for feeding back business requirements to the R&D.""".

While user-centric activities represent the customer perspective, this activity takes concrete steps towards successful exploitation from the point of view of the R&D partners. There are two major factors, which determine the impact and thus the exploitation potential of an IP: cost and benefit. Key to exploitation is the project visibility – making prospective users and the prospective community in general aware of the project’s benefits. Within LOD2, we lower the cost of adopting LOD technologies by aligning project outcomes with relevant standardization activities.""".
