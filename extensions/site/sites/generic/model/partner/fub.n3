<p>The Web-based Systems Group at Freie Universität Berlin explores technical and economic questions concerning the development of global, decentralized information environments. Its current focus lies on the publication and interlinking of structured data on the Web using Semantic Web technologies.</p>
<p>The group has initialized several widely used open source software projects including D2RQ, D2R Server, RAP – RDF API for PHP, and NG4G – Named Graphs API for Jena. The group contributes to several open data publishing efforts including DBpedia and the W3C Linking-Open-Data project which aims at interlinking large numbers of data sources on the Web. The Web-based Systems Group is active within the World Wide Web Consortium where it has contributed to the SPARQL recommendation and participates in the Semantic Web Education and Outreach activity. The group maintains strong research ties with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Hewlett-Packard Labs, and the Open Archives Initiative.</p>""";
    lod2:abstract """<p>Freie University Berlin will bring in expertise, tools and outreach capabilities to LOD2:</p>
<ul>
<li>FUB has developed and maintains the Silk – Link Discovery Framework and Link Quality Assurance Workbench, which will be significantly extended and integrated into the LOD2 Stack.</li>
<li>FUB has developed D2R Server, the most widely used tool for publishing relational databases as Linked Data on the Web. D2R Server will be used for the domain complementation task in WP3 and will be included together with Pubby and Silk into the LOD2 Stack (WP6).</li>
<li>Within WP10 Training, Dissemination, community building, FUB will use its existing community building (initiator of W3C LOD) and outreach capabilities (Linked Data on the Web (LDOW) workshop series, Semantic Web Challenge competition series) to maximize the impact of LOD2.</li>
