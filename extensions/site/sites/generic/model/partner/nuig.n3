National University of Ireland, Galway (NUI, Galway) - Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI) is one of the main actors in research and development of semantic technologies in the world. NUIG performs research in the Semantic Web, social networks, sensor network platforms and applies its research results to solve integration problems in various application-oriented projects in eLearning, eGovernment, eBusiness, and eHealth. NUIG develops advanced Semantic Web infrastructures, such as Semantically Interlinked Online Communities (SIOC), semantic search engines (SWSE, Sindice), and platforms for running large-scale, data-intensive experiments, which facilitate collaborative social working environments, scalable storage and reasoning engines, distributed computing, and ontology development. NUIG actively participates in and leads research funded by the EU FP7 program (FAST, Romulus, Okkam, CONET, PECES, iMP), the EU FP6 program (DIP, SUPER, SemanticGov, NEPOMUK, TripCom, RIDE), Science Foundation Ireland (LION) and Enterprise Ireland (SAOR, eLITE).

    lod2:abstract """NUIG will guarantee technical excellence in reliable large-scale data processing with the
same practices which have been daily driving the works behind the Sindice and Sig.ma projects. NUIG will
provide the relevance, feasibility and consensus of the initiative thanks to the continuous interaction between
the Linked Data community and the Linked Data Research Centre, a cross institute initiative.""".
