The use of case studies is twofold. Firstly, they are used to extract requirements, which guide the core R&#38;D process. Secondly, case studies are also used to validate the results and evaluate their applicability and impact. User centric activities will, additionally, validate our technologies viz. provide the evaluation environment. Each case study will incorporate a technology partner who is responsible for supporting the use case partners in deploying and using LOD2 R&#38;D results and for feeding back business requirements to the R&#38;D.</content>

While user-centric activities represent the customer perspective, this activity takes concrete steps towards successful exploitation from the point of view of the R&#38;D partners. There are two major factors, which determine the impact and thus the exploitation potential of an IP: cost and benefit. Key to exploitation is the project visibility – making prospective users and the prospective community in general aware of the project’s benefits. Within LOD2, we lower the cost of adopting LOD technologies by aligning project outcomes with relevant standardization activities.</content>

&#60;p&#62;The Stichting Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica (CWI) is the Dutch national research institute for mathematics and computer science. It is a private, non-profit organization located at the Science Park Amsterdam. CWI’s mission is twofold: To perform frontier research in mathematics and computer science, and to transfer new knowledge in these fields to society. This is realized by several means. In addition to the standard ways of disseminating scientific knowledge, CWI actively pursues joint projects with external partners, provides consulting services, and stimulates the creation of spin-off companies. Special efforts are made to make research results known to non-specialist circles, ranging from researchers in other disciplines to the public at large. CWI also manages the Benelux Office of the W3C and hosts both the Semantic Web Activity Lead and the chair of the XHTML and XForms Working Group.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;CWI has always been very successful in participating in European research programmes (e.g. VITALAS, K-SPACE, QAP, CREDO, MUSCLE, and others) and large-scale national research programmes (e.g., programmes BRICKS, MultimediaN, and VL-e; NWO Veni, Vidi, Vici grants). It has extensive experience in managing these collaborative research efforts. CWI is also strongly embedded in Dutch university research: about twenty-five of its permanent senior researchers hold part-time positions as professors at universities and many projects are carried out in cooperation with university research groups. CWI receives a basic funding from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), amounting to about two third of the institute’s total income. The remaining third is obtained through national research programmes, international programmes, and contract research commissioned by industry. CWI hosts a staff of 235 full time employees, 50 permanent scientific staff, 135 temporary scientific staff, and 50 support staff. The Information Systems (INS) group led by Prof. Dr. Martin Kersten is participating in the LOD2 proposal.&#60;/p&#62;</content>

&#60;p&#62;The Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF) is a not-for-profit organization founded in 2004 and dedicated to promoting open knowledge in all its forms. It is a European leader in this field and prominent on the international stage. The Foundation has pioneered work in developing robust legal mechanisms for sharing data - and has taken a central role in helping to develop standards for openness in knowledge and services. It also works on the infrastructure for open data users and producers. This includes CKAN, a community driven resource for open data, which is currently being used by the UK Government for its Data.gov.uk project, and KForge, a suite of tools for knowledge development being used by academic researchers and civic software developers. Finally it hosts a number of open data and content projects, from a web application to represent UK public finance using best of breed visualization technologies to project to a database of artistic works that have fallen into the public domain. Crucially the Foundation acts as a hub, drawing together representatives from across the knowledge society - from academics, public servants and entrepreneurs to data experts, archivists and web developers. Forums, workshops and an annual conferenceserve to strengthen this network.&#60;/p&#62;

&#60;p&#62;TenForce is a Belgian software company specialized in delivering pragmatic solutions for complex problems. TenForce has years of international experience in knowledge management combined with an in-depth expertise in emerging technologies. Besides designing, marketing and supporting their in-house product – a web-based management environment for project and operational activities – , they conduct several projects on European scale focusing on modelling complex systems. Delivering services in high-end semantic technology for industrial purposes is their core business: taxonomy management systems, generic portal technology for international publishers or the European Commission. Next to this TenForce has extensive experience in building, integrating and setting up corporate and web-based applications in several industries: telecom, services, banking, manufacturing. Already in 2001 TenForce developed a Thesaurus Management System for Wolters Kluwer Belgium that is still being fine-tuned and maintained today. Since 2007 TenForce has been building a multilingual multipurpose publishing solution for Wolters Kluwer Legal, Tax &#38; Regulatory Europe – based on semantic technology (OWL, RDF). Using the same technologies, TenForce is building a Thesaurus Management System for the Office of Official Publications of the European Commission (OPOCE) since summer 2008. In this project the so-called EUROVOC-thesaurus is made available through an online portal, for which an extension to existing SKOS standards needed to be defined. Another TenForce project on a European scale - called EURES -, scopes to make similar sets of information available through SPARQL end-points and as Linked Open Data, besides the latter web services.&#60;/p&#62;</content>

    <sioct:WikiArticle rdf:about="http://lod2.eu/Welcome">
        <content>Over the past 3 years, the semantic web activity has gained momentum with the widespread publishing of structured data as RDF. The Linked Data paradigm has therefore evolved from a practical research idea into a very promising candidate for addressing one of the biggest challenges in the area of intelligent information management: the exploitation of the Web as a platform for data and information integration in addition to document search. To translate this initial success into a world-scale disruptive reality, encompassing the Web 2.0 world and enterprise data alike, the following research challenges need to be addressed: improve coherence and quality of data published on the Web, close the performance gap between relational and RDF data management, establish trust on the Linked Data Web and generally lower the entrance barrier for data publishers and users. With partners among those who initiated and strongly supported the Linked Open Data initiative, the LOD2 project aims at tackling these challenges by developing:
&#60;ol&#62;
&#60;li&#62;enterprise-ready tools and methodologies for exposing and managing very large amounts of structured information on the Data Web,&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;a testbed and bootstrap network of high-quality multi-domain, multi-lingual ontologies from sources such as Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;algorithms based on machine learning for automatically interlinking and fusing data from the Web.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;standards and methods for reliably tracking provenance, ensuring privacy and data security as well as for assessing the quality of information.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;li&#62;adaptive tools for searching, browsing, and authoring of Linked Data.&#60;/li&#62;
&#60;/ol&#62;
We will integrate and syndicate linked data with large-scale, existing applications and showcase the benefits in the three application scenarios of media &#38; publishing, corporate data intranets and eGovernment. The resulting tools, methods and data sets have the potential to change the Web as we know it today.
