<p>WKD is involved in LOD2 with its dedicated “Business development and Strategy” department. This department is e.g. responsible for strategic product development and innovation.

<p>WKD is a legal publisher, aiming at legal and financial professionals. Main target groups are lawyers, tax advisers, companies (e.g. HR departments), social and health insurances, public administrations and schools. In addition, one business unit is dealing with B2C customers, mainly offering software for income tax return. The media portfolio spreads from traditional paper books, magazines and loose-leafs to mere software solutions, including also offline, online and intranet solutions. Main brands are “Carl Heymanns Verlag”, “Luchterhand”, “Addison Software”, “CW Haarfeld”, “Deutscher Wirtschaftsdienst” and “Carl Link”.</p>
<p>International Subject Matter Expert (SME) teams like the “European Content Core Team” or the global “SME team on Associative Retrieval” use e.g. collaboration tools and video presentations on a regular basis in order to transfer best practices and know-how into all WK branches. The project members are also part of a number of these teams and will thus disseminate LOD2 results to all WK branches worldwide. Dedicated interest in LOD2 was e.g. already signalled e.g. from Wolters Kluwer Spain.</p>""";
