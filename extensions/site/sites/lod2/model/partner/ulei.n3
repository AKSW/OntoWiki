    lod2:content """<p>Universität Leipzig is one of the oldest (founded 1409) and largest (30.000 students) universities in Germany and focuses on interdisciplinary research in the life sciences, cognitive sciences and linguistics as well as mathematics and computer science. The Institute for Applied Computer Science (InfAI) at Universität Leipzig hosts world class research groups in service sciences, knowledge engineering and management as well as natural language processing. The approximately 20 researchers of the Agile Knowledge Engineering and Semantic Web (AKSW) research group at InfAI are establishing theoretical results and scalable implementations for the field. Particular emphasis is given to areas such as ontology creation and manipulation, knowledge extraction, ontology learning and information & data integration on the Semantic Web. The implemented tools and services developed by the group enjoy considerable popularity, the open-source semantic web framework OntoWiki for example is downloaded more than 500 times each month and applied in usage scenarios ranging from the authoring of bio-medical ontologies to knowledge management for the enterprise. InfAI is leading several large-scale collaborative research projects on the national and EU levels such as OntoWiki (EU FP7), Internet Media Businesses (EU SMART), PreBIS (German BmbF) and Factory ServNet (Eureka) and participates in many more.</p>""";

<p>OntoWiki is a tool providing support for agile, distributed knowledge engineering scenarios. It facilitates the visual presentation of a knowledge base as an information map, with different views on instance data. It enables intuitive authoring of semantic content, with an inline editing mode for editing RDF content, similar to WYSIWIG for text documents.</p>
<p>OntoWiki provides sophisticated means for navigating, visualising and authoring of RDF-based Knowledge Bases. It serves and consumes Linked Data and comprises a comprehensive middleware API for building custom Semantic Web applications.</p>
<p>We refer to it as a Wiki, since our focus is on simplicity, adaptability and collaboration. However, other than annotating text-based Wiki pages with a special syntax (as suggested by text-based Semantic Wiki approaches), Onto Wiki uses RDF in the first place to represent information. For human users, Onto Wiki allows to create different views on data, such as tabular representations or maps. For machine consumption it supports various RDF serialisations as well as RDFa, Linked Data and SPARQL interfaces. Since its introduction in 2006, the application has evolved into a framework for building Semantic Web applications and was recently updated to support the collaboration across multiple domains and application via Semantic Pingback and RDFauthor</p>

<p>Triplify provides a building block for the “semantification” of Web applications.  Triplify is a small plugin for Web applications, which reveals the semantic structures encoded in relational databases by making database content available as RDF, JSON or Linked Data.</p>
<p>Triplify is very lightweight: It consists of only a few files with less than 500 lines of code. For a typical Web application a configuration for Triplify can be created in less than one hour and if this Web application is deployed multiple times (as most open-source Web applications are), the configuration can be reused without modifications.</p>
<p>Triplify makes Web applications easier mashable and lays the foundation for next-generation, semantics-based Web searches.</p>

<p>The DL-Learner software learns concepts in Description Logics (DLs) from examples. Equivalently, it can be used to learn classes in OWL ontologies from selected objects. It extends Inductive Logic Programming to Descriptions Logics and the Semantic Web. The goal of DL-Learner is to provide a DL/OWL based machine learning tool to solve supervised learning tasks and support knowledge engineers in constructing knowledge and learning about the data they created.</p>
<p><strong>Purposes of Class Expression Learning</strong>:
<ol>
<li>Learn Definitions for Classes: Based on existing instances of an OWL class, DL-Learner can make suggestions for class definitions to be included as an owl:equivalentClass or rdfs:subClassOf Axiom. As the algorithm is biased towards short and human readable definitions, a knowledge engineer can be supported when editing the TBox of an ontology (see <a href="http://dl-learner.org/wiki/ProtegePlugin">Protege Plugin</a>).</li>
<li>Find similar instances: DL-Learner's suggested class expressions can be used to find similar instances via retrieval (Concept definitions as search). Scalable methods allow the generation of recommendations on the fly, e.g. in a web scenario (see <a href="http://navigator.dbpedia.org/">DBpedia Navigator</a> – in experimental stage).</li>
<li>Classify instances: The learned class descriptions can be used in a typical classification scenario, i.e. to decide for unknown instances whether they belong to a certain class. Common ILP benchmarks have been tested with DL-Learner. On the <a href="http://dl-learner.org/wiki/Carcinogenesis">Carcinogenesis page</a>, DL-Learner competes with other state-of-the-art ILP algorithms.</li>
