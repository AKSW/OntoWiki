National University of Ireland, Galway (NUI, Galway) - Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI) is one of the main actors in research and development of semantic technologies in the world. NUIG performs research in the Semantic Web, social networks, sensor network platforms and applies its research results to solve integration problems in various application-oriented projects in eLearning, eGovernment, eBusiness, and eHealth. NUIG develops advanced Semantic Web infrastructures, such as Semantically Interlinked Online Communities (SIOC), semantic search engines (SWSE, Sindice), and platforms for running large-scale, data-intensive experiments, which facilitate collaborative social working environments, scalable storage and reasoning engines, distributed computing, and ontology development. NUIG actively participates in and leads research funded by the EU FP7 program (FAST, Romulus, Okkam, CONET, PECES, iMP), the EU FP6 program (DIP, SUPER, SemanticGov, NEPOMUK, TripCom, RIDE), Science Foundation Ireland (LION) and Enterprise Ireland (SAOR, eLITE).

Billions of pieces of metadata are on
the Web today, with increasing uptake across the Internet from
 <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=21997" >search engines</a> to 
 <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph" >social sites </a> to 
 <a href="http://data.gov.uk/" >governments </a> alike.

The key technologies are 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>, 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/">RDFa</a> 
and <a href="http://microformats.org/">Microformats</a>. Examples
of such information types are contacts, events, social networks, web
polls, reviews, and hundreds of other domain specific entities.

<strong>Sindice is a state of the art infrastructure to process, consolidate and query the Web of Data</strong>. 

Sindice collates these billions of pieces of metadata into an coherent umbrella of

<p><a href="http://Sig.ma">http://Sig.ma</a>is a tool to explore and leverage the Web of Data. At any time, information in Sigma is likely to come from multiple, unrelated Web sites - potentially any web site that embeds information in RDF, RDFa or Microformats (standards for the Web of Data).</p>
<p>Sig.ma can be used in 3 main ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a Web of Data browser: start from any entity and then click to another from the resulting page. Remember you are browsing a “network of mashups”, quite a unique thing. It might be noisy but you can spot gems, e.g. interesting description differences in different sources.</li>
<li>As an embeddable/linkable widget: create a Sigma, refine it and when you’re ready to paste it around in emails and twits or embed it on your blog. Sigmas are “data live”: if one of your selected sources updates its information, so will your Sigma be updated wherever it shows.</li>
<li>As a semantic API: retrieve entity descriptions and specific properties. For example picture,phone@Giovanni Tummarello , ready to consume, in JSON, in RDF.</li>
