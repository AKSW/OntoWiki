    lod2:content """
<p>The Stichting Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica (CWI) is the Dutch national research institute for mathematics and computer science. It is a private, non-profit organization located at the Science Park Amsterdam. CWI’s mission is twofold: To perform frontier research in mathematics and computer science, and to transfer new knowledge in these fields to society. This is realized by several means. In addition to the standard ways of disseminating scientific knowledge, CWI actively pursues joint projects with external partners, provides consulting services, and stimulates the creation of spin-off companies. Special efforts are made to make research results known to non-specialist circles, ranging from researchers in other disciplines to the public at large. CWI also manages the Benelux Office of the W3C and hosts both the Semantic Web Activity Lead and the chair of the XHTML and XForms Working Group.</p>
<p>CWI has always been very successful in participating in European research programmes (e.g. VITALAS, K-SPACE, QAP, CREDO, MUSCLE, and others) and large-scale national research programmes (e.g., programmes BRICKS, MultimediaN, and VL-e; NWO Veni, Vidi, Vici grants). It has extensive experience in managing these collaborative research efforts. CWI is also strongly embedded in Dutch university research: about twenty-five of its permanent senior researchers hold part-time positions as professors at universities and many projects are carried out in cooperation with university research groups. CWI receives a basic funding from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), amounting to about two third of the institute’s total income. The remaining third is obtained through national research programmes, international programmes, and contract research commissioned by industry. CWI hosts a staff of 235 full time employees, 50 permanent scientific staff, 135 temporary scientific staff, and 50 support staff. The Information Systems (INS) group led by Prof. Dr. Martin Kersten is participating in the LOD2 proposal.</p>""";
