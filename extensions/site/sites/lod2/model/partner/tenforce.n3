<p>TenForce is a Belgian software company specialized in delivering pragmatic solutions for complex problems. TenForce has years of international experience in knowledge management combined with an in-depth expertise in emerging technologies. Besides designing, marketing and supporting their in-house product – a web-based management environment for project and operational activities – , they conduct several projects on European scale focusing on modelling complex systems. Delivering services in high-end semantic technology for industrial purposes is their core business: taxonomy management systems, generic portal technology for international publishers or the European Commission. Next to this TenForce has extensive experience in building, integrating and setting up corporate and web-based applications in several industries: telecom, services, banking, manufacturing. Already in 2001 TenForce developed a Thesaurus Management System for Wolters Kluwer Belgium that is still being fine-tuned and maintained today. Since 2007 TenForce has been building a multilingual multipurpose publishing solution for Wolters Kluwer Legal, Tax & Regulatory Europe – based on semantic technology (OWL, RDF). Using the same technologies, TenForce is building a Thesaurus Management System for the Office of Official Publications of the European Commission (OPOCE) since summer 2008. In this project the so-called EUROVOC-thesaurus is made available through an online portal, for which an extension to existing SKOS standards needed to be defined. Another TenForce project on a European scale - called EURES -, scopes to make similar sets of information available through SPARQL end-points and as Linked Open Data, besides the latter web services.</p>""";
