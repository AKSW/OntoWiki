Exalead's technology provides users with a single access point to information, regardless of format or location. Its patented Search by SerendipityÂ® navigation system adapts to user habits. Exalead devotes substantial efforts in supporting research and innovation for helping customers succeed and to be in the forefront of emerging technology developments. Therefore, Exalead is engaged in European and French research projects with academic partners and some of the industry's top research organizations to forge new ground in the analysis, classification and usage of digital multimedia content, ranging from text, speech, and music to images and video.</p>""";
    lod2:abstract """Exalead will contribute and advance components of its search engine infrastructure, with emphasis on semantic linked data and search on linked data. Exalead search technology will be adapted and integrated as a component in the LOD2 Stack. An open search API will be developed to browse and access to the semantic linked data. As an (application) service provider in corporate environments, Exalead will lead the specification, setup and implementation of the enterprise use case (WP8). In addition to this, Exalead will provide a prominent channel for exploiting this use case and the outcomes of the LOD2 project as a whole.""";
