    <li>As a Web of Data browser: start from any entity and then click to another from the resulting page. Remember you are browsing a “network of mashups”, quite a unique thing. It might be noisy but you can spot gems, e.g. interesting description differences in different sources.</li>
    <li>As an embeddable/linkable widget: create a Sigma, refine it and when you’re ready to paste it around in emails and twits or embed it on your blog. Sigmas are “data live”: if one of your selected sources updates its information, so will your Sigma be updated wherever it shows.</li>
    <li>As a semantic API: retrieve entity descriptions and specific properties. For example picture,phone@Giovanni Tummarello, ready to consume, in JSON, in RDF.</li></ul>""".
