This page controller is used for display normal pages.


If you want to change OntoWikis starting page to a page,
you need to create this config options in you config.ini:

index.default.controller = "page"
index.default.action = "example"

further, you need to create a file named example.phtml
in the subdir page and you can configure a title of your
page in the component.ini (maybe you need to copy the
dist file for this)
